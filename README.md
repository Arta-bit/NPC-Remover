This script is perfect for Roleplay (RP) servers. It removes all NPCs, ensuring only real players remain for a more immersive experience.

How to Set Up:

1 : Create a folder named nps in your resources directory.

2 : Place the following files inside the folder:   || fxmanifest.lua  ||  client.lua  ||



3 : In your server.cfg, add the line:   ensure nps

By using this script, all NPCs will be removed from the server, providing a cleaner and more authentic RP environment.
We hope you enjoy it!
